The suite, as it's shaping up, October 2000:

Taught.pm  -- needs to be updated, to mesh with some of the other stuff

Taught::Definer -- useful for the roster and course-description files,
                    also likely to become useful for grade files.

Roster.pm  -- a subclass of Definer.  It understands the roster format,
              and also provides object methods (in addition to the tied
              hash access) to create lists and grids.

CFile.pm        -- defines the course description file

BareFile.pm -- ancestor class for roster and class list.

GradeTool.pm -- define grade calibrations and such

Gradesheet.pm -- defines the grade sheet 

Gradereport.pm -- defines the grade report file



Standalone programs:

makelist2
makegrid2
gradelog
gradereport
setup
prepterm

Still needed:

A way to update one student at a time.

Add creation of grade sheets to setup, or automate it per term/course.

Automatically do grade reports for a whole term/course.


Here's how it should go:

ONE-TIME SETUP:

./setup

START OF SEMESTER:

./setup -t fall2000 --copy fall1999
(create rosters by hand)
./prepterm -t fall2000          # recursively create all grids and lists
./makegradesheets -t fall2000   # do all the grade sheets, per roster/cfile, for all sections
  # should be part of prepterm

DURING SEMESTER

(update rosters by hand)
./makegradesheets -t fall2000   # will preserve any grades that are there, will weed out students
                                # who are no longer in roster.
./loggrade -t/c/s               # log a section's grades for an assignment

END OF SEMESTER

./loggrade -t/c/s               # if still needed
./dogrades -t [-c [-s]]         # recursively do grading in all sections
